        <p class="lead">Development is the path towards success. Development is not just restricted to 
            mass scale and beautiful construction but it's also in terms of Technology. Nowadays the world
            is rising in terms of technology. No one ever thought that equipments can be made to work without
            wires. But it has been made possible by wireless technology invention.
          Nowadays we are using Wireless Headphones to Wireless Computers. The wires were like a maze
          and very difficult to manage but coming of wireless has really solved the problem.

          <h3> MORAL OF THE CONTENT: ALWAYS THINK TO BUILD A TECHNOLOGY WHICH COULD SOLVE A REAL LIFE
              PROBLEM. </h3>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Improving Technology!!! <span class="text-muted"></span></h2>
          <p class="lead">Desktop Computers existed but somebody thought the need for improving their design 
              and finally LCD computers came. Also the processor within CPU was very slow and it took time to load
              content and playing games was like dream. But with time the processors were improved and journey which 
              started from single core processor has reached 48 cores by today. The journey is still going on. 

              <h3>MORAL OF THE CONTENT: DON'T STOP AFTER BUILDING SOMETHING. THERE IS ALWAYS A CHANCE OF IMPROVEMENT.

          <p class="lead">  There were desktop computers but people felt the need of portable computers.
              This led to discovery of laptops. The laptops are as efficient as computers and can be carried
              with us. The journey didn't stop here. The engineers made the size of laptop screen small and 
              called them tablets. The tablets are pretty good in usage. Then size was decreased to the size
              of mobile phone and they are called THE Smart Phones. Smart Phones are the mini computers.

           <h3> MORAL OF THE CONTENT: TECHNOLOGY HAS TO BE ADVANCED AND FOR THAT WE NEED TO KEEP OURSELF
               UPDATED WITH THE TECH. </h3>
